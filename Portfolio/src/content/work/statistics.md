**Graph Insight:** This graph shows a clear trend in how interactions (likes, comments, shares) have evolved over the past month. We see peaks that correlate with high-impact posts, demonstrating the value of engaging content.

**Takeaway:** Strategic content that resonates with our audience significantly boosts engagement.
